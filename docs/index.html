# SUCCESS STORIES SECTION
success_stories_heading: Success Stories
success_stories_subtext: Do foundations really work for projects? Here are some experiences that CASS projects have had with foundation membership. For more information see <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/17065562">https://zenodo.org/records/17065562</a>
success_stories:
  - title: Spack
    content: To continue to grow adoption, the Spack team wanted to remove any doubt that the project would remain open. The Spack team had received feedback from some companies that with LLNL as the single controlling organization, it was difficult for them to invest time in the project or to advertise Spack as a solution for users... Membership in HPSF has proven helpful for Spack. It led to Spack having publicly documented governance and a steering committee that can make decisions for the project. As part of HPSF, the Spack team hosted a user meeting with over 50 attendees as part of the inaugural HPSFCon 2025 and also collaborated with other projects at the conference.
  - title: Kokkos
    content: As a multi-institutional project, Kokkos needed a neutral home for governance to encourage sustained development commitment from these (and future) institutions. Furthermore, the project needed help with managing community resources such as the website, outreach efforts and user group meetings. For these reasons, Kokkos joined HPSF as a founding member... The first HPSF conference, which hosted the Kokkos user group meeting, was much more professionally organized and had a lower burden on the Kokkos team than the previous user group meetings. The project hopes this professionalization will also lead to potential industry customers having a better impression of the project. The outreach effort of HPSF has also helped the project significantly. Not only has the management of social media presence by LF staff been useful, it also encouraged the team to produce more outreach material such as blogs (https://hpsf.io/blog/) that then are amplified by the HPSF team.
  - title: AMReX
    content: AMReX has been committed to open source since its inception in 2017. Although historically its development has been centered in LBNL and other DOE labs, AMReX has a growing community of users and contributors at international laboratories such as CEA and DESY, as well as those in universities and private industry in the US and abroad. A desire to continue to grow this community was a key factor in the AMReX teamâ€™s choice to join HPSF. HPSF has helped formalize our governance model and development practices, which will only become more important as the project grows.
  - title: PETSc
    content: Though scientists at ANL continue to play a major role in PETSc development, the bulk of its development now takes place at other institutions in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. This evolution led to the PETSc community joining NumFOCUS in 2024... Each project retains ownership of its trademarks, logos, and intellectual property; none of these are transferred to NumFOCUS. The PETSc community has benefited from its membership with NumFOCUS and plans to continue its involvement in the NumFOCUS community.
