### 3. Research Grant Opportunities

&#10148; [**NSF 25-511: Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT)**](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/exlent-experiential-learning-emerging-novel-technologies/nsf25-511/solicitation?WT.mc_ev=click&WT.mc_id=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)

**Funding Amount**: up to $1M over 3 years  
**Deadline**: February 24, 2025 (full)  
**Summary**:

Through this initiative, the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU) and the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), in partnership with Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) through the Micron Foundation, seek to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals from all professional and educational backgrounds, resulting in increased access to, and interest in, career pathways in emerging technology fields (e.g., advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, quantum information science, semiconductors, and microelectronics). Large-scale challenges like advances in microelectronics or artificial intelligence also require a STEM workforce that brings varied perspectives and expertise to further accelerate the translation of science and engineering discoveries into large-scale solutions. Moreover, as current and new emerging technologies continue to evolve, unforeseen issues around security, safety and privacy will impact the preparation of the workforce. Emerging technologies are also dynamic and rapidly changing, with career entry and advancement often requiring "learning-by-doing" experience, even for those with some STEM education. Therefore, NSF recognizes that a competitive emerging technology workforce must include individuals from traditional and nontraditional education pathways as well as those individuals who may have “stopped” out of traditional educational pathways.

&#10148; [**NSF \- Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE)**](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems)

**Funding Amount**: Up to $1.5M over 2 years  
**Deadline**: January 14, 2025 (preliminary), April 22, 2025 (full)  
**Summary**:

Vulnerabilities in an open-source product and/or its continuous development, integration and deployment infrastructure can potentially be exploited to attack any user (human, organization, and/or another product/entity) of the product. To respond to the growing threats to the safety, security, and privacy of open-source ecosystems (OSEs), NSF is launching the Safety, Security, and Privacy for Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE) program. This program solicits proposals from OSEs, including those not originally funded by [NSF’s Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose) program, to address significant safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities, both technical (e.g., vulnerabilities in code and side-channels) and socio-technical (e.g., supply chain, insider threats, and social engineering). 

&#10148; [**NSF \- Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)**](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pose-pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems)

**Funding Amount**: 30-50 awards from a pool of $28M  
**Deadline**: January 14, 2025 (Phase I) and September 2, 2025 (Phase I and II)  
**Summary**:

The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program aims to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and/or government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.
