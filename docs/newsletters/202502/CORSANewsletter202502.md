&#10148; [**Insights and Impact From Five Cycles of Essential Open Source Software for Science**](https://zenodo.org/records/11201216)

For the past five years, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has supported the maintenance, growth,
development, and community engagement for critical open source tools that are used globally in
the life sciences through its Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program. To our
knowledge at the time of writing, this program (193 grants with $51.8 million in funding)
represents the largest initiative to meet these needs. Stories and data from this unique grantee
community represent one of the best available accounts on the impact of the open source
foundations of science, and the urgent need to continue and expand support for them. In this
report, we set out to review the impact of the first five cycles of the EOSS program to date from
multiple perspectives and a variety of data sources, highlighting the support required to sustain
OSS as well as the successes of our community.

announces its interest in basic research to explore potentially high-impact approaches in
scientific computing and extreme-scale science.

Supporting "...significant innovation [...] in the development of effective paradigms and approaches for realizing the full potential of scientific computing from emerging technologies. The proposed research should not focus on a specific science use case, but rather on creating the body of knowledge and understanding that
will inform future advances in extreme-scale science. Consequently, the funding [...] is not intended to incrementally extend current research in the area of the proposed project."

Reasearch topics include:

* Quantum computation based on topological concepts
* Local and Campus-Area Quantum Networking for Next Generation Parallel Quantum
Computing
* Neuromorphic Computing
* Computational Physical Systems
* Deep Understanding of AI Models

&#10148; [**Early Career Research Program**](https://science.osti.gov/grants/FOAs/-/media/grants/pdf/foas/2025/DE-FOA-0003450-000002-2.pdf)

**Funding Amount**: up to $16M over 2 years  
**Deadline**: February 18, 2025 (pre-applications), April 22, 2025 (close date)  
**Summary**:

The DOE SC hereby invites applications for support under the Early Career Research Program in the following program
areas: Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR); Basic Energy Sciences (BES);
Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Fusion Energy Sciences (FES); High Energy
Physics (HEP); Nuclear Physics (NP); Isotope Research and Development (R&D) and
Production (DOE IP); and Accelerator R&D and Production (ARDAP). The purpose of this
program is to support the development of individual research programs of outstanding scientists
early in their careers and to stimulate research careers in the areas supported by SC

&#10148; [**Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC): Partnerships in Basic Energy Sciences**](https://science.osti.gov/grants/FOAs/-/media/grants/pdf/foas/2025/DE-FOA-0003515-000002.pdf)

**Funding Amount**: $40M over 4 years  
**Deadline**: February 21, 2025 (pre-applications), April 25, 2025 (full)  
**Summary**

The DOE SC programs in Basic Energy Sciences (BES) and Advanced Scientific Computing
Research (ASCR) announce their interest in receiving applications from interdisciplinary teams
to establish partnerships under the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC)
program in specific targeted topic areas that relate to the BES and ASCR missions.

All applications must address fundamental research in support of the BES and ASCR missions.
Partnerships between domain scientists in the fields of materials science, condensed matter
physics, chemical sciences, geosciences, energy-related biosciences, applied mathematics, and
computer science will be critical to accelerate the scientific discovery process through
revolutionary advances in models, mathematics, algorithms, data, and computing. The integrated
teams will engage with the SciDAC Institutes and make full use of DOE’s classical high-
performance computing capabilities. In addition, applications must focus on one of three topics:
Complex dynamical systems for energy-relevant chemical and/or physical systems and materials;
Reliable and explainable Artificial Intelligence for chemical and/or physical mechanism
extraction from phenomena; and Foundation Models for chemical and materials sciences.

&#10148; [**NSF 25-511: Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT)**](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/exlent-experiential-learning-emerging-novel-technologies/nsf25-511/solicitation?WT.mc_ev=click&WT.mc_id=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)

**Funding Amount**: up to $1M over 3 years  
**Deadline**: February 24, 2025 (full)  
**Summary**:

Through this initiative, the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU) and the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), in partnership with Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) through the Micron Foundation, seek to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals from all professional and educational backgrounds, resulting in increased access to, and interest in, career pathways in emerging technology fields (e.g., advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, quantum information science, semiconductors, and microelectronics). Large-scale challenges like advances in microelectronics or artificial intelligence also require a STEM workforce that brings varied perspectives and expertise to further accelerate the translation of science and engineering discoveries into large-scale solutions. Moreover, as current and new emerging technologies continue to evolve, unforeseen issues around security, safety and privacy will impact the preparation of the workforce. Emerging technologies are also dynamic and rapidly changing, with career entry and advancement often requiring "learning-by-doing" experience, even for those with some STEM education. Therefore, NSF recognizes that a competitive emerging technology workforce must include individuals from traditional and nontraditional education pathways as well as those individuals who may have “stopped” out of traditional educational pathways.
