### **About OMSF**

The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is a nonprofit organization that provides governance, infrastructure, and financial support for open-source projects in molecular sciences. We help researchers, developers, and industry partners build sustainable, high-impact software by offering operational resources, community engagement, and long-term strategic guidance.

We work with researchers looking for new ways to make their work sustainable, industries that want to promote open science, and community-based projects focused on events, education, and stewardship.

### **Getting Started with OMSF**

The core of the Open Molecular Software Foundation is its hosted projects \- groups of talented people that drive innovation, foster collaboration, and contribute to our broader ecosystem.

Hosting your project with OMSF means aligning with its commitment to open science and open-source principles while benefiting from an established infrastructure for funding management, governance, and community support.

To begin, consider:

* How your project fits within the computational molecular sciences domain.  
* Your commitment to open-source licensing and public code availability.  
* Your governance model and how decisions will be made within your project.  
* Your plan for financial sustainability, including potential funding sources.

OMSF is happy to work with you in structuring your proposal. If interested in hosting your project at OMSF, reach them at [info@omsf.io](mailto:info@omsf.io)

### **Structuring Your Proposal**

When preparing your project for consideration, include:

**Overview:** 

* Provide your project’s name, a description, and a statement of its goals.   
* Outline your project’s leadership framework, governance, and structure  
* Consider your community standards, such as a Code of Conduct.

**Governance and Structure:** 

* Define your project's leadership framework. Whether you have an advisory board, a technical leadership team, or a single project director, your governance model should ensure accountability and effective decision-making.   
* If you need help, OMSF can assist\! Reach out to [info@omsf.io](mailto:info@omsf.io) for guidance.

**Alignment:**

* Detail how your project aligns with OMSF’s commitment to the values of open science.  
* Outline your funding strategy \- whether through industry partnerships, government grants, or philanthropic support, tell us how you plan to sustain your project over time.  
* Consider how your project complements other OMSF-hosted projects to foster collaboration and shared success. Find that information here: [omsf.io/programs/projects/](http://omsf.io/programs/projects/)

**Planning and Development:** Clearly articulate your project's roadmap:

* What are your key milestones and deliverables?  
* What is your anticipated timeline for achieving them?  
* How will you measure progress and success over time?

Do you not know the answer to some of these? That’s okay\! If you’d like guidance in how to answer these questions, reach out to [info@omsf.io](mailto:info@omsf.io), and OMSF will be happy to help.

1. **Initial Inquiry**: Prospective projects submit a proposal to [info@omsf.io](mailto:info@omsf.io)  
2. **Introductory Call**: A meeting between the project leads and OMSF representatives to discuss fit, expectations, and potential next steps.  
3. **Formal Application**: Submission of a detailed proposal covering governance, licensing, sustainability, and technical roadmap.  
4. **Review and Feedback**: OMSF evaluates the proposal, providing feedback and identifying areas for alignment or improvement.  
5. **Decision & Onboarding**: Approved projects receive an integration plan and guidance on leveraging OMSF’s resources.

### **What Happens in the Introductory Call?**

The introductory call serves as an opportunity for both OMSF and the prospective project to evaluate mutual alignment. Key topics covered include:

* The project’s mission, goals, and current status  
* The challenges the project faces and how OMSF can assist  
* Expectations for governance, infrastructure, and sustainability  
* The potential pathway for onboarding and next steps

By the end, you will have a good idea if OMSF is the correct fit for you. Regardless, OMSF strives for an iterative process \- it wants to see your project be the best that it can be\!
