# Overview

There is broad community recognition from stakeholders in government, industry, 
and academia, involved in the development of scientific software that a 
strategy for securing the sustainability of scientific software is
urgently required, and needed to secure the Department of Energyâ€™s 
Office of Science (DOE SC) long-term vision of software sustainability.

Any successful strategy for scientific software sustainability will need to
encompass the whole community, and the Open Scientific Software Foundation (OSSF) centers around the creation 
of a unique partnership between these stakeholders in the form of a 
self-sustaining not-for-profit open-source organization that will facilitate 
the long-term stewardship of scientific software. 

Key to this approach is the fundamental importance of ensuring that the 
environment that supports the software is sustainable. This means creating 
a community that is invested, works toward common goals, shares important 
ideas, and provides common services and infrastructure that benefit the 
whole community. A community working this way can result in
something that is greater than the sum of the individual parts.

# Mission

Our mission is to establish a not-for-profit organization that will act as 
an open and transparent facilitator that allows collections of teams, groups, 
and organizations to advance scientific software through a shared ecosystem. 
The type of foundation model we are envisioning has proved highly successful 
for open-source software, where foundations espouse neutrality, open 
participation, meritocracy, collaboration, and are self-maintaining. 
They have clearly demonstrated that sustainable funding models are not only 
achievable, but are fundamental to ensuring that the open source software 
ecosystem continues to proliferate.

# Organization

An Open Scientific Software Foundation would provide a range of services that
would be available for all participating projects. Examples of these services include:
- infrastructure (such as CI/CD)
- FAIR data and DOI minting
- software engineering training and eduction
- standards and guidelines
- badging and incentives
- legal and IP advice
