# Overview

There is broad community recognition from stakeholders in government, industry, 
and academia, involved in the development of scientific software that a 
strategy for securing the sustainability of scientific software is
urgently required, and needed to secure the Department of Energyâ€™s 
Office of Science (DOE SC) long-term vision of software sustainability.

Any successful strategy for scientific software sustainability will need to
encompass the whole community, and the OSSF centers around the creation 
of a unique partnership between these stakeholders in the form of a 
self-sustaining not-for-profit open-source organization that will facilitate 
the long-term stewardship of scientific software. 

Key to this approach is the fundamental importance of ensuring that the 
environment that supports the software is sustainable. This means creating 
a community that is invested, works toward common goals, shares important 
ideas, and provides common services and infrastructure that benefit the 
whole community. A community working this way can result in
something that is greater than the sum of the individual parts.

# Mission

Our mission is to establish a not-for-profit organization that can act as 
an open and transparent facilitator allowing collections of teams, groups, 
and organizations to advance scientific software through a shared ecosystem. 
The type of foundation model we are envisioning has proved highly successful 
for open-source software, where foundations espouse neutrality, open 
participation, meritocracy, collaboration, and are self-maintaining. 
They have clearly demonstrated that sustainable funding models are not only 
achievable, but are fundamental to ensuring that the open source software 
ecosystem continues to proliferate.

# Organization

An Open Scientific Software Foundation would provide a range of services that
would be available for all participating projects. Examples of these services include:
- infrastructure (such as CI/CD)
- FAIR data and DOI minting
- software engineering training and eduction
- standards and guidelines
- badging and incentives
- legal and IP advice
