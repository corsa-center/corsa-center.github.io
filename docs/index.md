# Vision

The Center for Open-Source Research Software Stewardship and Advancement (CORSA) serves as a community of practice that enables pathways for open-source scientific software projects to avail themselves of resources for long-term growth, stewardship, advancement, and innovation.

# Mission

To promote sustainable practices in the research software community and support the development, maintenance, and long-term viability of research software.

# Community

Our community comprises any open source scientific and reserarch software projects interested in sustainablity. We are founding members of the [Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS)](https://cass.community).

# Key Components
- **Pathways to Foundations:** Assisting the research software ecosystem to avail the resources and community structure of open source software foundations.
  - [NumFOCUS - How to Apply and Join](foundations/numfocus.html)
  - Information on other foundations coming soon
  - Foundations Forum
    - First meeting at noon CT on Wednesday Aug 28. Connection details shared via our mailing list and slack.
    - We'll generally try to have in these meetings: a) a short talk (e.g., update from a foundation, experience from an SSO with a foundation), b) discussion on a predetermined topic, and c) general announcements and discussion (related to open source foundations)
    - Anyone can suggest agenda items, or topics, etc. - so please let me know if you have ideas. This first meeting could include brainstorming about future organization, or I could talk about Parsl's desire to and process of joining NumFOCUS. 
    - Meetings will be open to anyone who wants to join - so please feel free to share this
    - Meetings will be recorded and posted on youtube, with links to them from a part of the CORSA website.
    - Meetings will be announced via the CORSA email list and the CASS #general and #wg-foundations slack channels

- **Sustainability Scorecards:** A framework for assisting resource software projects to understand and improve their sustainability.

# Benefits for Projects
- Comprehensive support for sustainable research software development
- Improved software sustainability and maintainability
- Enhanced skills and knowledge through education and training
- Guidance and consultation on sustainability practices
- Access to funding opportunities

# Benefits for Funding Entities
- Alignment with sustainable development goals
