# Vision

The Center for Open-Source Research Software Stewardship and Advancement (CORSA) serves as a community of practice that enables pathways for open-source scientific software projects to avail themselves of resources for long-term growth, stewardship, advancement, and innovation.

# Mission

To promote sustainable practices in the research software community and support the development, maintenance, and long-term viability of research software.

# Community

Our community comprises any open source scientific and research software projects interested in sustainablity and pathways to foundations. We are founding members of the [Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS)](https://cass.community).

# Key Components
- **Pathways to Foundations:** Assisting the research software ecosystem to avail the resources and community structure of open source software foundations.
  - [NumFOCUS - How to Apply and Join](foundations/numfocus.html)
  - [High Performance Software Foundation (HPSF) - How to Apply and Join](foundations/hpsf.html)
  - [Foundations Forum](meetings/foundations-wg.html)
  - [Benefits of joining a foundation](foundations/benefits.html)
  - Information on other foundations (e.g., Apache Software Foundation) coming next.

- **Software Sustainability Metrics:** Curating metrics that enable software projects to better understand and improve their sustainability. As part of this we identify software sustainability metrics frameworks and a set of tools that can enable projects to collect and analyze metrics specific to their software.

# Benefits for Projects
- Comprehensive support for sustainable research software development
- Improved software sustainability and maintainability
- Enhanced skills and knowledge through education and training
- Guidance and consultation on sustainability practices
- Access to funding opportunities

# Benefits for Funding Entities
- Alignment with sustainable development goals
- Increased impact of funding through collaboration
- Streamlined project selection based on sustainability criteria
- Diverse funding opportunities
- Collaboration and knowledge sharing within the research software community

# Open Source Software Funding Opportunities 
- The [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) has current open funding opportunities for [Building Sustainable Software Tools for Open Science](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-24-010.html) and [NIH Research Software Engineer (RSE) Award](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-24-011.html) These are two-year awards with a maximum funding of $300K per award. The RSE award application must also include a letter of support from an NIH-funded project PI.
- The [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/) has current open funding opportunities for the [National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2024/nsf24109/nsf24109.pdf?WT.mc_ev=click&WT.mc_id=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)
- The [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org) maintains a [list of funding opportunities for research software projects](https://www.researchsoft.org/funding-opportunities/).
