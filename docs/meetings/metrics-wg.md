# CASS Metrics Working Group

The Metrics Working Group aims to facilitate a coordinated effort to curate and develop metrics for measuring software sustainability from the perspective of 
scientific and research software. We seek input and participation from any scientific and research software project teams or members who are interested in 
understanding more about how to measure and improve the sustainability of their projects. Our goal is to create research-backed analysis tools that will 
enable projects to collect and interpret these metrics for the long-term benefit of their software development efforts.

The meetings are held bi-weekly and are open to anyone to attend.

Time: Every 2 weeks on Wednesday at 1pm PT, 3pm CT, 4pm ET
