title: CASS Foundations Working Group (Foundations Forum)
---

The foundations forum is an open forum for projets to meet and share experiences with joining or membership of an open-source software foundation (e.g. NumFOCUS, High Peformance Software Foundation, etc.) 

We will generally try to structure these forums around: 
- Benefits of software foundations
- Joining NumFOCUS, HPSF, or the Apache Software Foundation (and possibly others)
- Experiences with foundations (I can talk about Parsl and NumFOCUS, and others would be welcome to talk about their experiences with other foundations)
- Another foundation-related topic that the group chooses

Meetings will be open to anyone who wants to join - so please feel free to share this
- Meetings will be recorded and posted on youtube, with links to them from a part of the CORSA website ([see below](#past-meetings)).
- Meetings will be announced via the [CORSA email list](https://groups.io/g/corsa/join) and the CASS #general and #wg-foundations slack channels
