# Sustainable Project Pathways for HPC Software

In the realm of High-Performance Computing (HPC), the sustainability of research software is a pivotal concern that intersects with the capabilities and efficiency of supercomputing resources worldwide. But what does "sustainability" entail within the HPC context? How can we measure and enhance the longevity, efficiency, and adaptability of HPC software? How do we address testing challenges in performance portability, integration of machine learning (ML), heterogenous exascale architectures, and energy metrics in application software development? What are sustainable project pathways toward self-sustainment for projects of all sizes? 

This half-day workshop is dedicated to exploring the concept of sustainability in HPC software projects. Invited speakers will share several approaches to software sustainability from several perspectives: 1) testing software applications across heterogeneous architectures, developing platforms aimed at achieving maximum performance objectives with minimum energy consumption, and energy metrics toward green practices, and 2) existing metrics that have been defined by groups such as CHAOSS (https://chaoss.community), OpenSSF (https://openssf.org), and others for assessment and improvement, as well as how projects can engage in self-sustainment through pathways to various foundations and funding organizations. 

Through collaboration with the eScience community, CORSA (https://corsa.center/) seeks to address the sustainability challenges unique to HPC software, including but not limited to, managing the lifecycle of software on HPC platforms, ensuring compatibility with diverse and evolving hardware architectures, optimizing software for energy efficiency and computational performance, and engaging in self-sustainment through pathways to various foundations and funding organizations. By taking a holistic, cultural approach to this dimension, we aim to elucidate the sustainability needs of software and applications, leading to more comprehensive strategies for fostering resilient, efficient, and future-proof software ecosystems.
